# JDBC SQL injections 

This sample application creates a database and runs some commands in it. 
There is a SQL injection bug in the application's code. You have two tasks:

 - find an argument for deposit10 method which causes corruption in the database
 - fix the deposit10 method so that it works with all possible arguments 

The application uses an embedded H2 database (http://h2database.com). 
You don't need to install anything - just start the application and the database will automatically start inside your JVM. 

## Task 1: cause corruption in the database
Don't change the method deposit10 yet. 
Change the argument to deposit10 in the main method, so that one of the following happens:

 - money is deposited to ALL accounts instead of one
 - some new account is added
 - some accounts are deleted 
 
Only try out the "drop table" example if you can't get any of the above working!

## Task 2: fix the injection bug
Change the deposit10 method to use parameterized prepared statements. 
Make sure that the method works with the original argument "MÃ¤rt".
Verify that the argument string you created in task1 no longer hacks anything.   

## Results to submit

 - attack argument from task1
 - fixed deposit10 method
